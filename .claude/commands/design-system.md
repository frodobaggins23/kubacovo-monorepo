# Work on Design system

## Initial setup

- Run `npx nx storybook @kubacovo-monorepo/ui-components` as background process. Check if it was started correctly. If not inform user, kill the process and try to debug it.
- read libs/ui-components/TODO.md to evaluate current status of work
- read files in git staging are to understand what is currently being worked on
- get familiar with 'libs/ui-components/scripts/generate-component.cjs' generator and use it for first drafts of newly created components to achieve consistent results across sessions

## Development style

- follow communication style outlined in ./CLAUDE.md
- if there are multiple options how to implement given task, inform user and let him choose the correct one
